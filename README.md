Welcome to the AtliQ Grands Revenue Insights project ! In this project, I have implemented data analytics using Power BI to empower AtliQ Grands with the ability to make data-driven decisions, surpass competitors in the market, and drive growth in various aspects like Market Share & Revenue.

# Business problem:
AtliQ Grands is the proud owner of numerous opulent hotels throughout India. Yet, AtliQ Grands finds itself experiencing a decline in both market share and revenue within the luxurious/business hotel sector. 
I, as a data analyst, figure out the key problem of declining revenue using data analytics.

# Key Performance Metrics:
### Revenue:— Measure the total revenue generated by AtliQ Grands.

###  1. Realization Percentage:  — Calculate the percentage of actual revenue compared to the potential revenue.

###  2. Occupancy Percentage:   — Analyze the percentage of occupied rooms to the total available rooms.

###  3. Average Daily Revenue:    —Determine the average revenue earned per day.

###  4.  Daily Booked Rooms per Night:    Track the number of rooms booked daily.

###  5.  Average Rating:    — Evaluate the average hotel customer rating.

# Data modeling:
Data modeling plays a pivotal role and serves as the foundation for generating meaningful reports. The entire framework of visualizations is constructed upon a well-designed data model. Neglecting proper data modeling can have adverse effects on the overall performance of the generated reports.

In the context of this project, we have meticulously followed the Snowflake data modeling method. This approach involves structuring data into normalized forms, resulting in reduced redundancy and improved query performance. This methodology enhances the way we organize and process data, ensuring optimal results for our analysis.
